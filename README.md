# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted to create a web-based game that can be run on multiple platforms. For the game they wanted to have more than one team involved in the game, they wanted unique team, game and players names and finally theyre can only be one instance of the game exisiting in memory at any time.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think something I did well in devloping this documentation was the UML diagram. One of my goals was to udnerstand OOP concepts and to utilize them and I think the model is good practice in understanding how each class relates to one another in the code.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Understanding the design constraints helpe in focusing what functionalities are important to have in the program.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
