# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted to create a web-based game that can be run on multiple platforms. For the game they wanted to have more than one team involved in the game, they wanted unique team, game and players names and finally theyre can only be one instance of the game exisiting in memory at any time.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think something I did well in devloping this documentation was the UML diagram. One of my goals was to udnerstand OOP concepts and to utilize them and I think the model is good practice in understanding how each class relates to one another in the code.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Understanding the design constraints helped in focusing what functionalities are important to have in the program. Knowing that one of the things I needed to do for instance was creating checks to see if a teams name was unique and if it was then it can be added to the game instance but if not then a new name had to be picked.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think the chart with the server side client side and development tools I would probably redo. Trying to find good information about different OS was difficult initially because sometimes information was more opinionated rather than facts or some recommmendations where outdate or suggested depricated tools so. Recently I have been watching more videos of fullstack development and I think with that knowledge as it improves I would be able to udnerstand the relationships between the diffferent OS a lot better. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I recognized the needed functionalities of the software that the clients required and addressed those first and made sure that they reached the required results. Its important to understand the  primary concerns of the client to make sure we are not creating features that the clients will not utilize or would not server their intended purpose. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I think utilizing OOP principles is a good way to design software to reduce complexity of the code and make it more readable and easier to maintain. For example if we wanted to make it to where we wanted extra features to the teams then we can just adjust their attributes without having to redo other parts of the code that utilizes that class such as the game class.
